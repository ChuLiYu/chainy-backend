# Troubleshooting Solutions Documentation

## Overview

This document records the problems encountered during the chainy short URL service development and their solutions. All sensitive information has been removed or replaced with placeholders.

## 1. DNS and CloudFront Configuration Issues

### Problem: DNS Conflict Between Services

**Issue:** Both `chainy.luichu.dev` and `luichu.dev` were configured in the same CloudFront distribution, causing routing conflicts.

**Root Cause:**

- `chainy.luichu.dev` was managed by Cloudflare
- `luichu.dev` was also configured in CloudFront
- DNS conflicts led to content display anomalies

**Solution:**

1. Separated the services by removing `luichu.dev` from CloudFront aliases
2. Configured `chainy.luichu.dev` to use its own S3 bucket origin
3. Updated CloudFront distribution to only handle chainy service

**Files Modified:**

- `current-cloudfront-config.json`: Removed `luichu.dev` from aliases, changed origin to `chainy-prod-web.s3-website.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com`

### Problem: S3 Bucket Region Mismatch

**Issue:** CloudFront origin pointed to wrong S3 region, causing `PermanentRedirect` errors.

**Root Cause:** S3 bucket `chainy-prod-web` was in `ap-northeast-1` but CloudFront was configured for `us-east-1`.

**Solution:**

- Updated CloudFront origin `DomainName` to `chainy-prod-web.s3-website.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com`
- Changed origin type from `S3OriginConfig` to `CustomOriginConfig` for S3 website endpoint

### Problem: CloudFront Origin Type Error

**Issue:** 403 Forbidden errors when accessing `chainy.luichu.dev`.

**Root Cause:** S3 bucket was configured for static website hosting, requiring `CustomOriginConfig` instead of `S3OriginConfig`.

**Solution:**

```json
"CustomOriginConfig": {
    "HTTPPort": 80,
    "HTTPSPort": 443,
    "OriginProtocolPolicy": "http-only",
    "OriginReadTimeout": 30,
    "OriginKeepaliveTimeout": 5,
    "OriginSslProtocols": {
        "Quantity": 1,
        "Items": ["TLSv1.2"]
    }
}
```

## 2. API Gateway and Lambda Issues

### Problem: "Failed to fetch" Errors

**Issue:** Short URL generation and Google login were failing with "failed to fetch" errors.

**Root Cause:** CloudFront was only allowing `HEAD` and `GET` methods, but API required `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`.

**Solution:**

- Updated CloudFront `DefaultCacheBehavior` to include all necessary HTTP methods
- Added API Gateway origin and specific cache behaviors for `/links` and `/links/*` paths

### Problem: CloudFront Routing Configuration

**Issue:** All requests were routed to S3 origin, causing 405 Method Not Allowed for API requests.

**Root Cause:** CloudFront lacked specific routing rules for API endpoints.

**Solution:**

- Added dedicated API Gateway origin
- Configured cache behaviors to route API paths to API Gateway origin
- Added static asset routing for `/assets/*`, `/*.html`, `/*.svg`

### Problem: Missing GET /links Route

**Issue:** 500 Internal Server Error when accessing "My Short URLs".

**Root Cause:** API Gateway was missing `GET /links` route to fetch user's short URL list.

**Solution:**

- Added `GET /links` route in API Gateway
- Modified `create.ts` Lambda handler to support both create and list operations
- Added `handleGetUserLinks` function with proper filtering

## 3. Authentication and Authorization Issues

### Problem: Google OAuth "Invalid OAuth code"

**Issue:** Google login was failing with "Invalid OAuth code" errors.

**Root Cause:**

- OAuth codes are single-use and time-limited (~10 minutes)
- Google client secret was not properly configured in Lambda environment

**Solution:**

- Implemented SSM parameter retrieval for Google client secret
- Added proper error handling for expired OAuth codes
- Updated IAM permissions for Lambda to access SSM parameters

### Problem: DynamoDB Table Name Mismatch

**Issue:** `ResourceNotFoundException: Requested resource not found: Table: chainy-prod-users not found`

**Root Cause:** Incorrect table name in `terraform.tfvars` and IAM policies.

**Solution:**

- Updated `users_table_name` from `chainy-prod-users` to `chainy-prod-chainy-users`
- Updated `users_table_arn` accordingly
- Fixed IAM policies to reference correct table names

### Problem: DynamoDB Reserved Keyword Error

**Issue:** `ValidationException: Invalid FilterExpression: Attribute name is a reserved keyword; reserved keyword: owner`

**Root Cause:** `owner` is a reserved keyword in DynamoDB.

**Solution:**

- Used `ExpressionAttributeNames` to alias `#owner` to `owner`
- Updated FilterExpression to use `#owner = :owner`

### Problem: Missing DynamoDB Scan Permission

**Issue:** `AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:Scan`

**Root Cause:** Lambda IAM role lacked `dynamodb:Scan` permission.

**Solution:**

- Added `dynamodb:Scan` permission to Lambda execution role
- Updated IAM policy for `chainy-prod-chainy-create` function

## 4. User Authentication and Data Isolation

### Problem: Anonymous Short Links Appearing in User's List

**Issue:** Short links created without authentication were showing in authenticated user's personal list.

**Root Cause:** `handleGetUserLinks` was returning all links without filtering by owner.

**Solution:**

- Modified `handleCreate` to set `owner: "user-placeholder"` for authenticated users
- Updated `handleGetUserLinks` to filter by owner and exclude soft-deleted items
- Implemented proper user authentication logic

### Problem: Hard Delete vs Soft Delete

**Issue:** User requested soft delete functionality to preserve data.

**Root Cause:** Original implementation used hard delete (removing records from database).

**Solution:**

- Modified `handleDelete` to use `UpdateCommand` instead of `DeleteCommand`
- Added `deleted_at` timestamp field
- Updated list queries to exclude soft-deleted items using `attribute_not_exists(deleted_at)`

## 5. Infrastructure and Deployment Issues

### Problem: Terraform State Conflicts

**Issue:** `S3 bucket already exists` and `CNAME already exists` errors during Terraform apply.

**Root Cause:** Resources were created manually but not in Terraform state.

**Solution:**

- Imported existing S3 bucket: `terraform import 'module.web[0].aws_s3_bucket.web' chainy-prod-web`
- Imported existing CloudFront distribution: `terraform import 'module.web[0].aws_cloudfront_distribution.web' EOJPSKY8NNVO2`

### Problem: Missing Environment Variables

**Issue:** Short URLs were returning API Gateway endpoint instead of CloudFront domain.

**Root Cause:** Lambda function was missing `CHAINY_SHORT_BASE_URL` environment variable.

**Solution:**

- Updated `terraform.tfvars` to include `web_domain`, `web_subdomain`, and `web_hosted_zone_id`
- Ensured `CHAINY_SHORT_BASE_URL` is correctly set to `https://chainy.luichu.dev`

## 6. Security and Configuration Management

### Problem: Google Client Secret in Terraform

**Issue:** User asked about securely managing `google_client_secret` in `terraform.tfvars`.

**Root Cause:** Storing sensitive information in version control is a security risk.

**Solution:**

- Commented out `google_client_secret` in `terraform.tfvars`
- Implemented SSM parameter retrieval in Lambda code
- Provided guidance on using environment variables or SSM for local development

### Problem: Lambda Code Deployment Issues

**Issue:** Lambda function code updates were not being deployed correctly.

**Root Cause:** Build process and deployment steps were not properly synchronized.

**Solution:**

- Updated `build-lambdas.mjs` to include `googleAuth` handler
- Implemented proper build and deployment workflow
- Added verification steps to ensure code updates are deployed

## 7. Cloudflare and CloudFront Architecture

### Problem: CloudFront Error 530 - Origin DNS Resolution Failed

**Issue:** Cloudflare Error 530 when accessing `chainy.luichu.dev`, showing "Origin DNS resolution failed" message.

**Root Cause:** 
- Cloudflare DNS was configured to point to a non-existent CloudFront distribution
- DNS record: `chainy.luichu.dev` → `d3hdtwr5zmjki6.cloudfront.net` (does not exist)
- The CloudFront distribution was never created or was deleted

**Symptoms:**
- Error 530 in browser
- Cloudflare error page with "Origin DNS resolution failed"
- DNS queries show Cloudflare IPs instead of CloudFront domain

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Issue:**
   ```bash
   # Check if CloudFront distribution exists
   aws cloudfront get-distribution --id d3hdtwr5zmjki6
   # Result: NoSuchDistribution error
   ```

2. **Create Missing CloudFront Distribution:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy web module to create CloudFront distribution
   cd chainy
   terraform apply -target=module.web -auto-approve
   ```

3. **Update Cloudflare DNS Configuration:**
   - **Old CNAME:** `chainy.luichu.dev` → `d3hdtwr5zmjki6.cloudfront.net` ❌
   - **New CNAME:** `chainy.luichu.dev` → `d3eryivvnolnm9.cloudfront.net` ✅
   - **Proxy Status:** ✅ Proxied (Orange Cloud)

4. **Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Test after DNS propagation
   curl -I https://chainy.luichu.dev
   # Should return HTTP 200 instead of 530
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Always verify CloudFront distribution exists before configuring DNS
- Use Terraform to manage both CloudFront and DNS resources together
- Monitor CloudFront distribution status regularly

### Problem: SSL Handshake Failure

**Issue:** Cloudflare 525 SSL Handshake Failed when proxying to S3 Website Endpoint.

**Root Cause:** S3 Website Endpoints only support HTTP, while Cloudflare was attempting HTTPS.

**Solution:**

- Changed Cloudflare SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Flexible"
- Alternative: Use CloudFront for SSL termination

### Problem: DNS Configuration Confusion

**Issue:** User was confused about the roles of CNAME, CloudFront, and Cloudflare.

**Root Cause:** Complex architecture with multiple CDN layers.

**Solution:**

- Created comprehensive architecture documentation
- Explained request flow: User → Cloudflare → CloudFront → S3/API Gateway
- Documented functional division and cost-effectiveness

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Always manage resources through Terraform to avoid state conflicts
2. **Security**: Never store sensitive information in version control; use SSM or environment variables
3. **Testing**: Test OAuth flows with fresh codes as they are single-use and time-limited
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for complex architectures
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging for debugging
6. **User Experience**: Consider user authentication and data isolation requirements
7. **Soft Delete**: Implement soft delete for data preservation and audit trails
