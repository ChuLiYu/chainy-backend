## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for production environment security hardening for the Chainy project. The plan is divided into 3 phases based on priority and urgency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Plan Overview

**Timeline**: 10-13 days  
**Phases**: 3 phases, implemented by priority

## ðŸ“… Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Days 1-4)

ðŸ”´ **Must be completed before production launch**

- SSM Parameter Store for secret storage
- Frontend integration
- Complete test suite

#### WAF Deployment (1 day)

- AWS managed rules
- Rate limiting (2000 requests/5 minutes)
- Known malicious input protection
- CloudWatch monitoring

### Phase 2: High Priority (Days 5-9)

ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended before production**

#### DynamoDB Encryption (2 hours)

- Static encryption
- Point-in-time recovery

#### S3 Encryption (1 hour)

- KMS encryption
- Bucket key optimization

#### CORS Restrictions (0.5 days)

- Whitelist specific domains
- Remove wildcard

#### CloudWatch Alerts (1-2 days)

- Lambda error alerts
- API 4XX/5XX monitoring
- DynamoDB throttling alerts
- SNS email notifications

#### Input Validation Enhancement (1 day)

- SSRF protection
- Enhanced URL validation
- Short code validation

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Days 10-13)

ðŸŸ¢ **Recommended to have**

#### GDPR Compliance (2-3 days)

- Data deletion API
- Data export API
- Privacy policy

#### Security Automation (1 day)

- GitHub Actions security scanning
- npm audit automation
- Terraform security checks

## ðŸ’° Cost Estimation

**Additional monthly cost**: ~$15-20

| Service    | Monthly Cost |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| WAF        | $5-10        |
| KMS Keys   | $1           |
| CloudWatch | $1-2         |
| SNS        | < $1         |

## âœ… Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [x] Main branch stable and pushed
- [x] New branch `feature/production-security-hardening` created
- [ ] Review budget ($15-20/month)
- [ ] Schedule implementation time
- [ ] Team member notification
- [ ] AWS permissions confirmation

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

You now have 3 options:

**Option 1**: Start Phase 1 implementation immediately  
Start implementing API authentication and WAF deployment

**Option 2**: Modify the plan  
If you have any adjustment needs for the plan, we can discuss

**Option 3**: Postpone implementation  
Save the plan documentation for later implementation
